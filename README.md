# Library Management System

A Spring Boot project to manage library operations including registering books, borrowers, and listing books. The project also includes validation, sanitization, and Swagger API documentation.

## Features

- Register a new borrower
- Register a new book
- List all books
- Borrow a book
- Return a book
- Swagger API documentation

## Prerequisites

- Java 17 or above
- Gradle
- PostgreSQL (or H2 for testing)
- IntelliJ IDEA (optional)

## Getting Started

To get started, first clone the repository using the command
`git clone https://github.com/yourusername/library-management.git` and navigate into the project folder with `cd library-management`. 

The project uses Gradle and Docker Compose, so make sure Gradle is installed on your machine or use the included Gradle wrapper, and ensure that Docker is running.

Once you are in the project directory, you can start the application and its dependencies by running `./gradlew composeUpAndRun`. 
This command will build the project, start the Spring Boot application, launch any required Docker containers such as PostgreSQL, and initialize the database. 

After running the command, the application will be accessible at `http://localhost:8080/`. 

The interactive API documentation generated by Swagger can be found at `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html`.

When you are done using the application, you can stop the running Docker containers by executing `./gradlew composeDown`. 
This will cleanly shut down the application and any dependent services.
